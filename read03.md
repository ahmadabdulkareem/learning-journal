**Version Control** is a system that allows you to revisit
various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to<br\>
 the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS).
 ## Git : <br\>
   Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.<br\>
   Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary
    information can be found in local resources.
    this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002.

 Next **Pushing** you would use this function:
*$ git push origin master* <br\>

 You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges.<br\>
 you can view the short names, such as “origin,” by running: *git remote*. <br\>
 and to view all the remote URLs run: *git remote -v* <br\>
 Example: 

 $ git remote -v
*remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)*
*remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)*
*remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)*
*remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)*
